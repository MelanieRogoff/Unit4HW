# Unit4HW

The goals of this assignment are to:

* Have user be presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." upon landing. 


* Have user click the "Start Quiz" button to begin a series of questions, as well as a timed countdown.


* Calculate score by time remaining - therefore, if user answers correctly in a fast-paced manner, they will achieve a higher score. If users answer incorrectly, 15 seconds will be removed from the countdown, and the quiz will be needed to be completed at an even faster rate. 


* When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, user is given their final score and asked to enter their initials.

* Allow users to take this quiz across mobile and Desktop platforms, including tablets. 

* Create a buzzer (will be recorded audio saying "BZZT!") that sounds when the user selects the incorrect answers. 

* Have an aesthetically pleasing (likely pink and floral) background.
